Week 1

This week I and my partner Edgar Tonoyan decided to write a project, which is a data converter, which can convert an implementation to another language like json, html or cfe. So far we only wrote a little overview of the project, and discussed what we are supposed to cover until next week.


Week 2

We completed the prd template required for our project in order to start writing it next week. We decided to write a data converter code which will convert a git log written in the json file to html. The code will be written by C language,
either on the Terminal of Debian Linux or the Terminal of Mac OS.

Week 3

This week, we discussed the PRD templates of every project including our own, however our project's topic coincides with the topic of other students, so our discussion on Wednesday wasn't too long, so their project's discussion was the main part and helped us in order to better experience what we are supposed to implement during the implementation process.

Week 4

This week we were assigned to write the name of the functions of our program, so that we could better experience what our project is about, and what is supposed to be implemented in the code.

Week 5

This week is the final week of the project. This week we started working on the project, we submitted the half-complete version of the code on Friday, but the project will be complete by Monday. PRD Template will aslo be changed along with it. Also there will be a test function during the process of writing the code. The project has been completed and submitted on GitHub, also a presentation and a video have been committed to Github.
