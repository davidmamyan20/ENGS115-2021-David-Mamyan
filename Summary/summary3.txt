Today we discussed new topic, about the types and concepts of the codes. According to the instructor, today was one of the most important lectures in order to continue the course. During the class I was able to understand the difference between the objects, models and concepts. First we declare the concept, then the model and in the end the object. We discussed different examples, during the lecture in order to better understand the topic. For example, University was mentioned as a model, and AUA was declared as an object. So it's like first when we declare concept, we explain what its objects include in order to better understand the following concept. Also the example of the types of numbers were discussed like the different types, for example integer, rational number, real number and natural number.
