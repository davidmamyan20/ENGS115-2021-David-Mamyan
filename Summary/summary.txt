In the lecture, we discussed one of the videos we were supposed to watch at home. The video was about Big O notation, where the woman brought 4 steps of Big O notation 1.) Different steps get added, 2.)Drop constants, 3.) Different inputs and different variables, 4.) Drop non-dominate terms. Then we tried to understand the asymptotic notation. I understood that there are some codes, which do a lot of steps in a second, I think that is why there is a Big O notation, like O(n). Dropping constants means if O(n) becomes O(2n), it means we can simply write O(n) again, because n is not a constant number. Then we had a little discussion about the git, we knew about the creation of github and what its goal was. I think the goal was to create a network that people could save their work and use it whenever they need it.
