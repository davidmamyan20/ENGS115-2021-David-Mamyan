Week 1

This week I and my partner Edgar Tonoyan decided to write a project, which is a data converter, which can convert an implementation to another language like json, html or cfe. So far we only wrote a little overview of the project, and discussed what we are supposed to cover until next week.

Week 2

We completed the prd template required for our project in order to start writing it next week. We decided to write a data converter code which will convert a git log written in the json file to html. The code will be written by C language,
either on the Terminal of Debian Linux or the Terminal of Mac OS.
