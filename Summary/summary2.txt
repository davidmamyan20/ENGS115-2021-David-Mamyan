During the class we starting learning more about GitHub and its commands, as I think all of us should know some information about the network which we use to save our projects there. We learnt about the difference between the staged and unstaged files, which were also familiar to us, because it simply included, git add, git commit and git push. At the last minutes of the lecture we discussed a question based on our new topic Big O Notations, and also got a home assignment to do.
