In today's lecture we started discussing different ways of sorting, which we were required to watch videos about it. We start with the selection sort. It chooses the current minimum, and compares with the current element of the array, if it's bigger than the minimum, their positions won't be swapped, if it's smaller than the minimum, their positions will swap. We use the first element for comparison, and when it is sorted, next time the loop works it will ignore the first element, and go to the next one. And after the first comparision current position and i, which is also a position of an array ++. About the bubble code which compare A[i] and A[i+1], and it will swap if A[i]>A[i+1], and the loop will be repeated again, unless the array is sorted. And every time it runs the last element is ignored, every time. We find the complexity of the bubble sort by adding numbers from 1 to n which is equal to n(n-1)/2, and after droping the constants and n with lower powers, we get O(n^2).
