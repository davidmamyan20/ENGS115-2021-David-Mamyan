In today's lecture we discussed the topic about the container. The topic was generally confusing, so we had to use different types of examples in order to understand the context. Container is a concept, and a concept is a group of types. Then we learnt how to compare the containers, and found out that in order to compare them, they should be linear. So the containers are equal when they are the same in size and they are both linear. Another things to add are just some requirements for the specific containers. For non-negative number complexity should be liner in the container's size, then in the case of max the complexity should be amortized constant time, and the same should be done for the empty containers.
